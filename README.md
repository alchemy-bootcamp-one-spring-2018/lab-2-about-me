# Lab 2 - Revision 1

Lab 2 consists of a simple "About Me" webpage. It has some basic biographical information, along with several games that the user can play to find out more about me - Injoong.

## Instructions and info
* The first game _Yes or No_ uses browser alerts and prompts to ask the user a series of questions. The questions are hard-coded using if-else statements.
* The other games take user inputs. For the _Favorite Number_ game, I used the parseInt() function to attempt to convert the user input into an integer.
* For the _Favorite Color_ game, the answer is "lightgreen".
* At the end of each game, a "Results" message will be outputted onto the HTML.
* I used Mozilla Developer Network documentation to look up some functions that I wasn't familiar with, along with referencing the in-class demo that Marty did.
