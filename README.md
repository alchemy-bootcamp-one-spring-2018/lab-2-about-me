#Lab-2: About Me Games

##Description
This is a a lab project for Alchemy Code Lab that presents a webpage with information about me and games to play to learn more about me. 

Games:
1. 5 Yes/No Questions
    *This function has 5 if...else/if...else statements to prompt user for a yes or no response. I included a score keeper so the user can learn their results once they finish all 5 questions. 
2. Guess the Answer: Where am I from?
    *The function for this game contains a For loop to limit the number of wrong answers the user can make to 3. 
3. User Input: Guess my favorite color?
    *In this game, I am looking for the user to guess my favorite color, which is a type of blue. I use if...else/if...else statements depending on their response. Again, I limit the number of guesses to 3 so that the user is not stuck in the game. 
4. User Input: Travel Bucket List
    *For this game, I wanted to take the focus off of me and learn a little about the user! I presented them with my top 3 countries to visit and then asked them where they would like to go. Based on the letter count of their response, the function will give them 1/3 responses to pursue their traveling dreams.
