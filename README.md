# lab-2-about-me

-This is a questionnair about me and my likes where users can play a guessing game to learn more about me.

-On the page, there are descriptions of the questions that they can ask. Users are required to press a "Play" button to initialize a prompt.
Once there, they will have a limited number of entries to guess the correct answer. Incorrect answers will be followed by an alert that will inform the user that they are wrong, then the game will continue. If the user runs out of guesses, they will exit the prompt and return to the main page.
