## Project Description
This project is a page of guessing games and trivia for the game Dota2.

## For Developers
The page has buttons that call a function, prompting a series of questions, mainly using if/else and for loops. Many of the games have been improved using arrays and objects to group together questions and answers, such that adding or subtracting more questions and trivia should be easy, while the prompting portion operates independently.

Here's a brief list of tools I used:
* Loops
* Arrays
* Objects
* .includes()
* Math.floor(Math.random() * x) for random integers
* shufflearray(array)
* input
* basic CSS
* prompt/alert
* document.getElementbyId()
