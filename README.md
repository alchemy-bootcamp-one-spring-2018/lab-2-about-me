## Learning a Little About Mark

This is a simple web page that presents some brief information about Mark, and his newly-started journey to becoming a full-time developer.
The page contains two fun games.

### What's under the hood
The webpage captures user information through the process of playing the games, and provides feedback to the user by:
1. Echoing user input back in alerts and prompts
1. Displaying number of remaining guesses and results of games in alerts
1. Logging questions, answers and game results to the console
1. Displaying a message within each game <div> that contains the results of the game, and score if applicable.
