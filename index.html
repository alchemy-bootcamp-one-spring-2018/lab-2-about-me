    <h1>Here's a little bit about me followed by a fun game!</h1>
    <p>My name is Antreo. I grew up in north Florida along the Suwannee River.</p>
    <p>I moved to the northwest in 1999 to go to school and graduated in 2006 with a BA in Audio Recording.
    I spent years as a freelance recording engineer but I'm looking for a more stable and dependable long term career so I'm really excited about becoming a web developer.</p>
