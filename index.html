    <p class="title">I'm Bobby</p>
    <p>I am 27 years old, born and raised in Portland, Oregon! I've lived a lot of different places and tried a lot of different things. In fact, travelling and doing new things is one of my favorite things to do! I also like laying around being lazy, reading, and telling strange stories that make no sense. I think dogs are fantastic and that humans don't deserve them. But hey, there's plenty of time to learn more about me. Click the buttons below and we can get to know each other!</p>
