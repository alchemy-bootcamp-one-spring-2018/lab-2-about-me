    <h1>Lab 2: About Me</h1>h1>

    <p>I graduated from high school with high honors and then continued my education at the American University of Beirut in Beirut, Lebanon, in the years that followed. When the time came to declare my major I chose to pursue a bachelor of science in biology with the intent to study medicine thereafter. As time wore on though I came to realize that the field of medicine was not one within which I desired to establish a career. Nevertheless, I was determined to complete the undergraduate degree. My time in Beirut from 2004 to 2012 was undoubtedly the most formative of my life. I had the privilege of living in a modern city with a deep historical backdrop; a cultural and international hub bursting with art, music, and new ideas; all juxtaposed by the regular political conflicts in Lebanon and the region.
