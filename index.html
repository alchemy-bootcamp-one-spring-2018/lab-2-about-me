    <h1>Lab 2: About Me</h1>

    <p>I graduated from high school with high honors and then continued my education at the American <br> University of Beirut in Beirut, Lebanon, in the years that followed. When the time came to declare <br> my major I chose to pursue a bachelor of science in biology with the intent to study medicine<br> thereafter. As time wore on though I came to realize that the field of medicine was not one within<br> which I desired to establish a career. Nevertheless, I was determined to complete the undergraduate<br> degree. My time in Beirut from 2004 to 2012 was undoubtedly the most formative of my life. I had<br> the privilege of living in a modern city with a deep historical backdrop; a cultural and international<br> hub bursting with art, music, and new ideas; all juxtaposed by the regular political conflicts in<br> Lebanon and the region.
