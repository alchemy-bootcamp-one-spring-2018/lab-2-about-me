        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I was born in South Korea, and moved shortly afterwards to Eugene, OR. We moved again a few years later and I spent most of my life on the east coast.</li>
            <li>After graduating from college with a BA in Film, I moved to Portland. It's real nice to be back on the west coast.</li>
            <li>I then worked for a couple years at a non-profit film organization here in downtown Portland.</li>
            <li>I love talking about movies, video games, and media studies in general, and I can get <em>pretty</em> pretentious about all of it.</li>
            <li>I'd love to eventually get a job as a web dev/software dev at a small company here in Portland, honing my programming skills and using them to make weird experimental games on the side.</li>
