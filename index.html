<h1>About Sarah</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Sarah, welcome to my quiz page. I'll tell you a little about myself, but not too much so you can blindly take my quiz. I live in Portland, OR. I moved here from Michigan in August 2003. I've worked a lot of different jobs, but my last job lasted almost 14 years. To be fair, I held different roles at the company over that time. And eventually there was nowhere else to go there. So now I'm in coding bootcamp, and I hope to get a job that I can really enjoy when I'm done.
