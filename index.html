        <section id="main">
            <p><span>Hi, I'm Mark.</span> Like you, I've decided to pursue being a developer because of my interest in programming.<br />I've been fooling around with programming for a LONG time, starting when my stepfather brought home an Atari 800 back in around 1981. I began programming in BASIC. </p>

            <p>I never pursued programming as a career back then, since most computer science programs in those days were very mathematically focused, and a math genius I am <strong>NOT.</strong></p>

            <p>Long story short - many years later, I'm really interested in taking my basic understanding of HTML and CSS to the next level, and get some formal training! I'm already enjoying learning JavaScript.</p>
